# kinode_process_lib

Library of functions for more ergonomic [Kinode](https://github.com/kinode-dao/kinode) process development. See the [Kinode Book](https://book.kinode.org) for a guide on how to use this library to write Kinode apps in Rust.

The major version of `kinode_process_lib` will always match the major version of Kinode OS. Since the current major version of both is 0, breaking changes can occur on minor releases. Once the major version reaches 1, breaking changes will only occur between major versions. As is, developers may have to update their version of process_lib as they update Kinode OS.
